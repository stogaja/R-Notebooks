<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

## Project Description

![alt text](https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/HsrktkqTURBXy8zMjhkNzM5NWY0NGExY2VlZWQyNmQ2YzVhODRhMjdkYy5qcGVnkpUDABXNArzNAYmTBc0CgM0BQA)

Carrefour is a French multinational retail corporation headquartered in Massy, France. The eighth-largest retailer in the world by revenue, it operates a chain of hypermarkets, groceries and convenience stores, which as of January 2021, comprises its 12,225 stores in over 30 countries (Wikipedia).

In Kenya, Carrefour has 8 outlets mostly located in the suburbs of Kenya’s capital city, Nairobi. The retailer’s expansion into Kenya has benefited from the failure of previously-dominant supermarket chains such as Nakumatt and Uchumi as Carrefour rushed in to occupy the retail spaces and market share they vacated.

### PCA and Feature Selection
Correct identification of the most important variables from the data set was important as this could reduce the amount of factors to be considered during decision making and planning, to only the most relevant factors.

### Association Rules
The insights derived from analysis of association rules were important for planning stocking, advertisements, and promotions (to boost sales). Therefore, highly accurate information was required to prevent incurring losses as a result of remaing with a larger than expected closing stock, especially perishable goods.

### Anomaly Detection
Correct detection of anomalies was of importance as under reporting of sales is a crime, as less taxes will be filed. Plus, this activity, as well as over reporting of sales could have lead to incorrect restocking of goods, leading to product shortages, or over stocking respectively. This could have lead to heavy losses being incurred, or a great sales opportunity being missed (limited supply of goods in demand).
